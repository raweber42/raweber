Hey! My name is Ralf, I'm a 25 year old Software Engineer born in Germany. Currently I am working as a DevOps/Backend engineer [in a bitcoin startup](https://www.lipa.swiss) in Bern, Switzerland. </br>
I discovered my passion for coding in 2020 and have been coding daily ever since. Besides my job as a DevOps engineer I am constantly improving my skillset. Right now I am building an app for around 5000 tenants in Serbia as a side project with two friends where I write the backend for an app in Go. Besides that I am deep-diving into SRE principles, networking and Kubernetes.
