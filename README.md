Hey! My name is Ralf, I'm a 24 year old Software Developer born in Germany. Currently I am working as a DevOps engineer at [lipa](https://www.lipa.swiss) in Bern, Switzerland. </br>
I discovered my passion for coding in 2020 and have been coding daily ever since. Besides my job as a DevOps engineer I am constantly improving my skillset. Right now I have a little side project where I write the backend for an app in Go and I am deep-diving into SRE best practices.
