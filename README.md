Hey! My name is Ralf, I'm a 23 year old Software Developer from Germany. Currently I am improving my coding skills at @[42 Wolfsburg](https://www.42wolfsburg.de)! </br>
I discovered my passion for coding in 2020 and have been coding daily ever since. Right now I am coding my own webserver in C++ and I am diving into app development with Flutter (I plan to release a first app by the end of the year!).

Besides that I am really passionate about sports (especially calistenics), economics and Bitcoin.

Feel free to checkout my repos!
